Automated OpenAPI documentation generator for Django. Djagger provides you with a clean and straightforward way to generate a comprehensive API documentation of your Django project by utilizing pydantic to create schema objects for your views.

**Djagger is designed to be:**


üßæ **Comprehensive** - Every aspect of your API should be document-able straight from your views, to the full extent of the OpenAPi 3.0 specification. 


üëê **Unintrusive** - Integrate easily with your existing Django project. Djagger can document vanilla Django views (function-based and class-based views), as well as any Django REST framework views. As long as you are using Django's default URL routing, you are good to go. You do not need to redesign your APIs for better documentation.


üç≠ **Easy** - Djagger uses pure, unadulterated pydantic models to generate schemas. If you have used pydantic, there is no learning curve. If you have not heard of pydantic, it is a powerful data validation library that is pretty straightforward to pickup (like dataclasses). `Check it out here <https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/>`_. Either way, documenting your APIs will feel less like a chore.


Quickstart
----------

Install using ``pip``

.. code:: bash

    pip install djagger

Add ``djagger`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting in your Django project like this:

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'djagger',
    ]
  

Include the djagger URLconf in your project ``urls.py`` like this if you want to use the built-in document views.

.. code:: python

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path('djagger/', include('djagger.urls')),
    ]

.. NOTE::
   * To see the generated documentation, use the route **/djagger/api/docs**. Djagger uses `Redoc <https://github.com/Redocly/redoc>`_ as the default client generator.       
   * To get the generated JSON schema file, use the route **/djagger/schema.json**.
